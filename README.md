 Prospers-Loan-data analysis
#Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found several interesting relationships between the dependent variable (LoanSatus) and these selected borrowers features: Prosper score or borrower risk, original loan amount, and debt to income ratio. I presented  the loan statuses distribution and its relationship with the variables listed above. The reason for my decision was to improve the storytelling follow and generate meaningful insights.

Additionally, employed borrowers had the highest amount of charged-off loans that borrowers under the remaining employment status, which was the opposite of my expectations.
